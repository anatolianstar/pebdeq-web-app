# 🔧 Duplicate Analytics Function Fix

If you're getting this error when running `python run.py`:

```
AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: emails.get_email_analytics
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix Instructions

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
python fix_duplicate_analytics_function.py
```

### Option 2: Simple Fix (Alternative)
```bash
cd backend  
python simple_fix_emails.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Fix
If scripts don't work, manually edit `app/routes/emails.py`:
1. Search for `get_email_analytics`
2. If you find duplicate functions, keep only ONE
3. Remove duplicate `@emails_bp.route('/admin/email/analytics', methods=['GET'])` decorators

## ✅ After Running Fix

Test if the fix worked:
```bash
python run.py
```

You should see:
```
* Serving Flask app 'app'
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5005

No more AssertionError! 🎉
